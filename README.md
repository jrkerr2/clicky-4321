# South Park Clicky Game

## Description
Memory card game using React & JSX; User must click random images in a grid to accumulate points, but after each click, the "deck" is shuffled; any incorrectly-chosen card resets the game to an initial state; card states are tracked, points accumulated, hi scores are "saved" between plays (using app state)
