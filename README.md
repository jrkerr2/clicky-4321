# South Park Clicky Game (...in progress 10/29/18)

## Description
Memory card game using React & JSX; User must click random images in a grid to accumulate points, but after each click, the "deck" is shuffled; any incorrectly chosen card resets the game to "init"; card states are tracked, points accumulated, hi scores are "saved"

## Installation & Use
- Play the game here: https://calm-lowlands-87835.herokuapp.com/
- Click on an image to get started, watch messages for instruction

## Technical Debt
- game won't reset/restart when an already-clicked image is clicked again after "loss"
- Message.js won't work when included - commmented out for now
- comments & pseud-code & console.logs: cleanup needed for readability
